### How to get started:

The image can be built from the `Dockerfile` by running:

        docker build . -t bgld

A recommended security practice is to add an additional unprivileged user to run the daemon as on the host. For example, as a privileged user, run this on the host:

        useradd bgld

To build an image which uses this unprivileged user's id and group id, run:

        docker build --build-arg USER_ID=$( id -u bgld ) --build-arg GROUP_ID=$( id -g bgld ) .

Now, when the container is run with the default options, the bgld process will only have the privileges of the bgld user on the host machine. This is especially important for a process such as bgld which runs as a network service exposed to the internet.
